## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

## Steps to Install this Project on Your PC

To install this Laravel project, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js**
- **Composer**
- **PHP v8** or later

### 1. Extract the Project Files
   - Unzip the `.zip` file from the repository to your desired project folder.

   - **Image Configuration (Faker)**: If youâ€™re using Faker to generate images, you may need to adjust the `Image.php` file within the vendor folder:
     - Open `vendor\fakerphp\faker\src\Faker\Provider\Image.php`
     - Add the following lines to bypass SSL verification:

       ```php
       curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, false); // Disable SSL host verification
       curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false); // Disable SSL peer verification
       ```

### 2. Set Up the Database
   - Open MySQL Workbench and create a new database with the same name as specified in the `.zip` file.
   - Go to the **Administration** tab, select **Data Import/Restore**, and choose the SQL file from the extracted `.zip` to import the tables.

### 3. Configure Database Connection
   - In the project root, create a `.env` file.
   - Add your database credentials and any other necessary environment variables to configure the connection.

### 4. Install Dependencies and Complete Setup
   - Open **Visual Studio Code** and run the following commands in the integrated terminal:

     ```shell
     composer install
     npm install
     php artisan storage:link
     php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
     ```

   These commands will install the necessary packages, link the storage directory, and set up the database with seed data.
